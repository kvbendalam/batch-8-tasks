    <h4>How to manager memory in Computers</h4>
    <p>Memory management is the process of controlling and coordinating a computer's main memory. It ensures that blocks of memory space are properly managed and allocated so the operating system (OS), applications and other running processes have the memory they need to carry out their operations.</p>

        <li>
            Allocation. When the program requests memory for an object or data structure, the memory is allocated to that component until it is explicitly freed up. The allocation process might be manual or automatic. If manual, the developer must explicitly program that allocation into the code. If the process is automatic, a memory manager handles the allocation, using a component called an allocator to assign the necessary memory to the object. The memory manager might be built into the programming language or available as a separate language module.

        <li>
            Recycling. When a program no longer needs the memory space that has been allocated to an object or data structure, that memory is released for reassignment. This task can be done manually by the programmer or automatically by the memory manager, a process often called garbage collection.
